- 👋 Hi, I’m Cristina!
- 👀 I’m a PhD candidate in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Toronto interested in molecular anthroplogy, human eveolutionary genetics, complex trait genetics and genotype-phenotype associations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about genotype-phenotype relationships for a variety of anthropological and medical applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on genome wide association studies (GWAS) of human pigmentation traits and other complex traits and diseases.  I am hoping to build this page into a resource for graduate students interested in learning about GWAS and other computational methods.
- 📫 I can be reached at my institutional email: c.abbatangelo@mail.utoronto.ca.
